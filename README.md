# Victor's Boilerplate Angular Frontend 

This is a boilerplate Angular (1.x) single page app based off [the yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) with some extras included like ui-router, and sass breakpoints.



## Build & development

You'll need Node and Sass installed.

After saving repository to desired location run `npm install -g grunt-cli bower yo generator-karma generator-angular` node dependencies, which includes Grunt, bower and the needed yeoman stuff. Then run `bower install` to install Bower depeencies.

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing
